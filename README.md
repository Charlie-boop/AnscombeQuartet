# AnscombeQuartet
A small exercises on data manipulation and visualization
In this project I had to opportunity to manipulate data in a demonstration of the importance of visualization, through the use of the "Anscombe Quartet"

The goals of this project were:
Understand the importance in data analysis and interpretation of plotting the data
Demonstrate the applications of plotting the graphs
Understand mean, standard deviation, and regression coefficients
Demonstrate the concept of the Anscombe quartet

For this simple exercise I used the library "car" and the Excel spreadsheet containing the sample data.
I carried multiple operations for summary statistics: standard deviation, mean and correlation. Additionally I carried out simple linear regression, ran Analysis of Variance tests and the levene test on the data. 
Finally I used scatterplots to visualize the data.

The data was perfectly adequate for all the tests I ran with it, in fact, all four groups of data seemed identical right up until I plotted them, which of course serves to prove the principle behind the "Anscombe Quartet". The testing was a success.
